Description of tests and approach to testing: 
- If you followed test-driven development, make a note of that here

Features of our solution we consider interesting:
- Customers can browse products via a categories drop-down, search, or just through the home page if they want to explore many different items/are not sure what they want to purchase
- Quantity alteration occurs in cart, whose page you are directed to after adding an item (as this will save time for the customer, for example if they are only purchasing one item or if they are not sure of quantities until everything is in their cart and want to change many quantities at once)
- The maximum quantity a customer can add to the cart is what is in stock according the the Northwind database
